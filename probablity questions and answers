1) When you toss a coin twice, what would be the sample space? 

S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}


2) When a pair of dice is rolled and sum of the numbers on the faces is recorded, what would be the sample space of this experiment?

S = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}


3) When a non-biased dice with 6 faces is thrown, what is the probability that the number shown will be even?

3/6


4) A simple experiment was performed where we took a non-biased dice and checked for the probability of even number. A total of 10 throws were done and found that 4 times an even number was obtained. Now what is the probability of even number.

4/10



5) What is the probability of getting a king from a deck of cards?

1/13


6) A jar contains 7 red balls, 5 green balls, 8 yellow balls and 15 blue balls. What is the probability that the ball randomly selected is a green or red ball?


12/35


7) What is the probability of getting a sum 9 from two throws of a dice?

1/9


8) Three unbiased coins are tossed. What is the probability of getting at most two heads?

7/8


9) 3 red and 6 green marbles are present in a bag. What is the probaility of getting a red marble?

1/3


10) What is the probability of drawing a king in the first draw and again a king in the second draw as well without replacement?

1/221


11) What is the probability of getting two heads in two tosses?

1/4

12) If you toss a coin and roll a die, then what is the probability of getting a tail and a four on the die?

1/12

13) Calculate the probabilty of gettinng 2 Aces back to back from a deck without replacing the first card?

1/221

14) We have a sample of 38 vehicles, 16 are red, 5 are trucks, and 2 are both. A randomly chosen vehicle is red. What is the probability it is a truck?

1/8


15) Spin a spinner numbered 1 to 7, and toss a coin. What is the probability of getting an odd number on the spinner and a tail on the coin?

2/7

16) The probability that it is Friday and that a student is absent is 0.03. Since there are 5 school days in a week, the probability that it is Friday is 0.2. What is the probability that a student is absent given that today is Friday?

0.15
